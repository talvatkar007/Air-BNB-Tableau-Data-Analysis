# Air-BNB-Tableau-Data-Analysis
Tableau project provides a valuable overview of Airbnb data in New York City. 
The visualizations effectively highlight pricing trends, room type preferences, and property characteristics. Further exploration of the data can lead to deeper insights into the Airbnb market in the city.
## "AIR BNB"
Clearly identifies the data source.
- Focus on Price & Room Type: The dashboard heavily emphasizes the relationship between neighborhood, room type (Entire home/apt, Private room, Shared room), and average price.
- Maximum Price Over Time: The "Year Vise Maximum Price" chart shows the highest listed price over the years, revealing potential trends or outliers.
- Room Rating: The "Room Vise Rating" section likely represents some form of aggregated rating or review score based on room type, highlighting differences in user satisfaction.
- Property Type Analysis: The dashboard explores property types, their bed counts, and average prices.
- Location Context: The borough names (Manhattan, Staten Island, Brooklyn, Queens, Bronx) provide the geographic context for the analysis.

## Potential Insights & Further Analysis:
- Pricing Disparities: The "Neighbourhood vise Average Price" chart reveals significant price differences across boroughs and room types. Manhattan is notably more expensive.
- Market Trends: The "Year Vise Maximum Price" chart can indicate how the luxury segment of the Airbnb market has evolved over time.
- User Preferences: The "Room Vise Rating" section can help understand user preferences for different room types.
- Property Characteristics: The "Property Vise Beds" and "Average Price (Property Type)" charts provide insights into the characteristics of different property types and their pricing.
- Location Analysis: Further analysis could explore factors influencing pricing in different neighborhoods, such as proximity to attractions, transportation, and amenities.
- Property Type Distribution: The "Property base Room Type" chart can be expanded to analyze room type distribution across all property types.
